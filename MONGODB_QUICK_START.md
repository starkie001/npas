# 🚀 MongoDB Migration - Quick Start

## ✅ What's Done

Your Next.js app has been fully migrated from JSON file storage to MongoDB with Mongoose!

### Files Created/Modified:
- ✅ **4 Mongoose Models** (User, Booking, Availability, Settings)
- ✅ **3 DAO Classes** (UserDao, BookingDao, SettingsDao)
- ✅ **3 Controllers** (UserController, BookingController, SettingsController)
- ✅ **Database Config** (dbConfig.js - converted to ESM)
- ✅ **Migration Script** (migrate-to-mongodb.js)
- ✅ **Test Script** (test-connection.js)
- ✅ **Updated package.json** with helper scripts

## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Set up MongoDB URI

Create or update `.env.local`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/npas
```

**For MongoDB Atlas (cloud):**
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/npas?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### 2️⃣ Test the connection

```powershell
npm run db:test
```

You should see:
```
✅ Successfully connected to MongoDB!
📊 Database Statistics:
   Users: 0
   Bookings: 0
   ...
```

### 3️⃣ Migrate your data

```powershell
npm run db:migrate
```

This will transfer all data from your JSON files to MongoDB.

## 🎉 That's It!

Your app now uses MongoDB! Run your app:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

## 🔥 Key Changes

### IDs are now strings (MongoDB ObjectIds)
```javascript
// Before: id: 1 (number)
// After: id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011" (string)
```

Your controllers have been updated to handle this automatically.

### Connection is cached
The app now uses connection caching to prevent connection limits during development hot-reloading.

### All CRUD operations work the same
Your existing code will work without changes - the DAOs handle all the MongoDB complexity.

## 💾 Your JSON Files

Your original JSON files are still there:
- `src/lib/dao/users-db.json`
- `src/lib/dao/bookings.json`
- etc.

**Don't delete them yet!** Keep them as backups until you've verified everything works in production.

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Connection issues?** Check:
1. Is MongoDB running? (for local installations)
2. Is `MONGODB_URI` in `.env.local`?
3. Can you connect with MongoDB Compass or `mongosh`?

**Migration issues?** Run:
```powershell
npm run db:test
```

**Still stuck?** Check the logs - all operations include detailed console logging.

Happy coding! 🎨✨
